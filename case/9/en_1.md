## Abstract

Intelligent perception and interaction can be divided into two major capabilities, namely, machine perception capabilities such as vision, hearing and touch, and human-computer interaction capabilities such as voice and action. The former is biased towards perceptual recognition, while the latter is biased towards application scenarios.

Intelligent perception is mostly about information transmission through camera, microphone or other sensor hardware devices in the physical world as "media". These "media" map the input content to the digital world, making cognition, understanding, memory, planning, decision-making, and so on.



Human-computer interaction is based on a variety of perceptual hardware devices to achieve instant interaction or other information transmission in specific scenarios.For example, in the field of autonomous driving, such sensing intelligence is realized through lidar and other sensing devices and A I algorithms.Home intelligent audio is also an application of speech recognition and interaction, by learning specific to contextual maps.



In the future, intelligent perception and interaction will be applied with more industrial scenarios, including warehousing, logistics, port, chemical industry, energy, etc. Intelligent perception interaction can play greater effects in the field of higher degree of mechanization.



## Analysis

Only by every scientific and technological revolution is deeply combined with industrial manufacturing and promoting the fundamental reform of the manufacturing mode and production organization mode, can we drive a leap in productive forces.The strategic position and head goose effect of artificial intelligence should be reflected in the deep integration with industrial manufacturing, thus promoting the fundamental reform of production line, workshop and enterprises, reshape production and operation, products and services, organizational process and other business scenarios, create industrial innovation forms, and promote the steady growth of industrial output value and employment.
