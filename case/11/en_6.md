## Analysis

The expansion of urban public space indicates that the city once dominated by production function is transforming into a livable city dominated by culture, leisure and health care functions. This is just as Aristotle said: "People come to cities to live and stay in cities to live better." Urban public space is a place for people's daily communication activities, which is not only related to the image of the city, but also the needs of residents' life and urban development. This requires that in the stage of space design and construction, it is necessary to get rid of the tendency of "emphasizing decoration and neglecting function" and give full play to the role of public space as an organic part of urban function. In this case, by integrating artificial intelligence into the space, the interest of the space can be increased, so that residents can relax wholeheartedly in various service facilities provided by the public space.
