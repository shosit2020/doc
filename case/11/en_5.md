For the first time, Green Orange demonstrated its "Green Orange Intelligent Control Center" used for urban vehicle management.Relying on Didi's massive travel data and A I computing platform, the system has built the prediction ability of Qingju's short-distance travel needs in the city. Through Beidou +GPS dual-mode high-precision navigation and positioning, "fixed-point vehicle return and entry settlement" is realized, combined with the big data management platform of Qingju, intelligent scheduling operation and vehicle allocation are optimized.
