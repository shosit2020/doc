## Abstract

With A I incorporated into the national strategy and the "new infrastructure" system, A I technology will play a positive role in upgrading China's medical industry.Sensetime not only uses A I to provide doctors with intelligent auxiliary tools to improve the efficiency of hospital diagnosis and treatment, but also continues to explore the frontier, break through the boundary of A I applications, and lead the sustainable development of the A I medical industry.

From auxiliary diagnosis and treatment, precision surgery to drug mining, AI+ medical treatment has rich application scenarios.Take SenseTime SenseCare intelligent diagnosis and treatment platform as an example. "time saving people, time, effort and precision" are the four values brought by AI image assisted diagnosis to the hospital.

Is adhering to the "based on medical big data, service clinical treatment" this concept, SenseCare wisdom treatment platform based on platform of flexible expansion, has launched including chest CT, chest X line, heart coronary, pathology, bone tumor and other product solutions, covering more than 13 human parts and organs, for multiple clinical AI power, help clinicians for high precision disease detection, typing, good and malignant prediction multidimensional analysis, and 3D preoperative planning and simulation treatment design.



During the COVID-19 period this year, S en s e C a r e Chest C T intelligent clinical solutions immediately rushed to key COVID-19 screening hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Hebei, Fujian and other provinces, providing an efficient and accurate decision-making basis for front-line medical workers."By introducing intelligent S en s e C a r e lung A I analysis products, we can realize intelligent diagnosis and quantitative evaluation of COVID-19 C T images, and complete quantitative analysis within a few seconds to automatically screen suspected images."Qingdao West Coast New District People's Hospital radiology director Wang Qijun said.The secret behind Wang Qijun and his team to issue inspection reports in the shortest time to avoid long-time retention and reduce the risk of cross-infection is artificial intelligence (AI) -assisted diagnosis.



## Analysis

The problem of difficult and expensive medical treatment is very prominent in China, mainly manifested in two aspects. One is the uneven distribution of medical resources.According to statistics, tertiary hospitals have nearly 90% of high-tech equipment and excellent medical personnel in the current medical service system. Serious insufficient medical equipment, low doctor density limit limited treatment ability and often need to be referred to large hospitals for subsequent diagnosis and treatment or conservative treatment; Second, primary hospitals are crowded, but tertiary hospitals and clinics are overcrowded every day, and the low proportion makes doctors under high pressure and disputes.In addition, combined with the sudden COVID-19 outbreak, the peak pressure of the "wartime" medical system cannot be met by relying on the traditional medical mode.



In the face of the above situation, through the supply-side reform, in addition to increasing the supply of medical resources, the use of A I technology to improve the use efficiency of medical resources is one of the effective ways to quickly alleviate the current shortage of medical resources:

First, through the AI algorithm to assist doctor diagnosis and treatment, can greatly reduce the burden on
and treatment platform for diagnosis
doctors, release the energy and time to handle more urgent events, diagnose and treat more patients, do more focused communication with patients, while reducing the pressure of the medical system is conducive to the benign development of doctor-patient relationship.


Second, the A I algorithm implements the expert experience and knowledge map digital, standardization, can copy and output, increase the overall supply of medical resources, quickly improve the medical level of grassroots hospitals, make patients in developed or remote areas, can be nearby, enjoy the basic homogeneous medical services, promote the balanced development of medical and health resources.

The application and promotion of AI in the medical field is in line with the Sustainable Development Goal III (SDG3) and Target Ten (SDG10) —— advocated by the United Nations to reduce inter-regional gaps and human inequality caused by insufficient resources and unequal distribution, ensuring that everyone has the power to pursue a healthy, happy life.
