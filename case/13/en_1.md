## Abstract

In July 2020, Microsoft joined forces with eight companies to develop a new initiative to accelerate the transition to a net-zero global economy. We recognize that a company alone cannot solve the global carbon challenge. Creating a multiplier effect on corporate climate change ambitions,The Transforming to Network Zero initiative aims to develop and provide research, guidance, and an implementable roadmap to enable all businesses to achieve net zero emissions. The initiative will be led by founding members including AP Moller-Maersk, Danone, Mercedes-Benz AG, Microsoft, Natura & Co, Nike, Starbucks, Unilever and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).


## Analysis

Climate change is now a major cause of massive population displacement and has been identified by the United Nations as a "threat multiplier": a catalyst for social, political and international conflict.

The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming 1.5 ° 2018 argues that limiting global warming to 1.5 ° C could "reduce the number of people at climate-related risk and vulnerable to poverty by as much as several hundred million by 2050". And to "reduce the challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being".
