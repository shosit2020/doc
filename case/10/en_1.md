## Abstract

Today, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, four billion people still cannot access the health services they deserve.The development of AI technology will surely bring about more equitable solutions. Microsoft launched the first industry cloud solution "Microsoft Medical Cloud" (Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare) ——, based on Microsoft's existing cloud services related to health industry needs and scenarios, can meet the main needs of the medical industry, including improving patient communication, strengthen medical team collaboration, improve operation and treatment data insight, and ensure interoperability, security and credibility of cloud computing.


## Analysis

The problem of difficult and expensive medical treatment is very prominent in China, mainly manifested in two aspects. One is the uneven distribution of medical resources.According to statistics, tertiary hospitals have nearly 90% of high-tech equipment and excellent medical personnel in the current medical service system. Serious insufficient medical equipment, low doctor density limit limited treatment ability and often need to be referred to large hospitals for subsequent diagnosis and treatment or conservative treatment; Second, primary hospitals are crowded, but tertiary hospitals and clinics are overcrowded every day, and the low proportion makes doctors under high pressure and disputes.In addition, combined with the sudden COVID-19 outbreak, the peak pressure of the "wartime" medical system cannot be met by relying on the traditional medical mode.

In the face of the above situation, through the supply-side reform, in addition to increasing the supply of medical resources, the use of A I technology to improve the use efficiency of medical resources is one of the effective ways to quickly alleviate the current shortage of medical resources:

First, through the AI algorithm to assist doctor diagnosis and treatment, can greatly reduce the burden on doctors, release the energy and time to handle more urgent events, diagnose and treat more patients, do more focused communication with patients, while reducing the pressure of the medical system is conducive to the benign development of doctor-patient relationship.

Second, the A I algorithm implements the expert experience and knowledge map digital, standardization, can copy and output, increase the overall supply of medical resources, quickly improve the medical level of grassroots hospitals, make patients in developed or remote areas, can be nearby, enjoy the basic homogeneous medical services, promote the balanced development of medical and health resources.

The application and promotion of artificial intelligence in the medical field is the concrete embodiment of SenseTime's A I ethical principles, and is also in line with the UN advocated Sustainable Development Goals (S D G 10 and S D G 3) —— to reduce the regional gap and human inequality caused by insufficient resources and uneven distribution, to ensure that everyone has the power to pursue a healthy and happy life.
